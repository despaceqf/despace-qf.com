[Space DAO](https://spacedao.ai) is a professional community driven initiative
dedicated to fostering collaboration and consensus for trust-augmented space
applications.

The goal is to remove the risks associated with a single dominant entity
controlling vital decision making information. Given the significant reliance on
space by various downstream applications, governments, and businesses, it's
essential to embrace a diverse and inclusive approach to governance.
