[The Observer Space Station project](https://twitter.com/VairagyaSadhana) aims
to create a online platform that serves as a hub of knowledge, education, and
entertainment for the space enthusiast community.

It focuses on promoting tech literacy, fostering space education and
edutainment, encouraging tech adoption, and enabling decentralized access to the
space ecosystem.

content. It will host weekly Twitter Spaces discussions to facilitate real-time
conversations with the space enthusiast community.
