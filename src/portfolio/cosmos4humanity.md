[Cosmos for Humanity (C4H)](https://cosmosforhumanity.eu/en) is a Swiss NGO
based in Neuch√¢tel whose mission is to promote the sustainable development of
space activities and to act to preserve Earth's orbits.

As part of a partnership with the French Space Agency (CNES), C4H has
conceptualised an indicator, the Outer Space Footprint (OSF). Like the energy
performance indicator, the OSF gives citizens and businesses the opportunity to
defend their interests in space by encouraging or sanctioning the behaviour of
space operators and their customers through their choice of consumption and
suppliers.
