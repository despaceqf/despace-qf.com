## For developpers and contributors

This website is using a static generator (Eleventy). All files are in the src/ folder.

In order to generate pages yourself you need the tools:
```bash
 npm install
```

You can generate the website with (this should be super fast):
```bash
 npm run build
```

You can have a live reload page when you do changes:
```bash
 npm run dev
```
